# [bushiweb.dev](https://bushiweb.dev): a developper's portfolio

**Project currently in development**

I'm Emeric, a french web developper. As I started freelancing, I figured I could use a cool portfolio, that reflects who I am. Thus was born **[bushiweb.deb](https://bushiweb.dev)**.

This project showcases my work as well as my personnality, and will be used as a stepping stone for my future projects.

As a JavaScript developper, I used _React_ to build the frontend, and _Express_ for the backend. I also plan on dabbling with SSR later on!

## Installation

Although this project has been build for my personnal use, if you are curious ou inspired by it, feel free to install it!

Right now, there is nothing to install, but this section will soon be updated.

## How to use the project

There are currently no fancy functionnalities. Just sit down and enjoy the view.

Still, the project is not closed for new uses!

## Testing

I will do my best to test the application thoroughly. When the first tests are ready to go, I'll tell you how to start them.
